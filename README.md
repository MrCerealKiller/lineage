# Lineage
A Roguelike fantasy game ⚔️

## @brief
Lineage _attempts_ to be a harmony between strategy games and classic fantasy
RPGs.

The game features character creation and indirect influence as the main
interaction between the player and the characters. Being unable to directly
control your heroes, you are only able to make general sweeping decisions for
them (i.e. go to this town and do this thing). Conversely, all individual
actions, such as battles, encounters, and minor decisions will be made based
on a character's stats, personality traits, etc.

## Setup and Installation

### Dependencies
_The game itself does not have any dependencies at the moment. However, the
project is setup to build using **Cmake** and the source uses some features
(e.x. inline qualifiers) only available in **C++13(+)**. If you don't have
access to C++13(+)know your way around C++ you should be able to resolve
this quickly._

### Installation
1. Using git commands or by downloading the zip file from Github, please get a
copy of the source code.

2. From the location that you cloned / extracted the files please run:
  * `cmake CMakeLists.txt`
  * `make`

3. The main executable will then be in `<path_to_source>/bin/bin/main`

4. For the time being, the game will be run using a CLI. Simply execute it
from the command-line as you would any other program.

## Contributing
The project is open-source for now. I may set it to private in the future.
If you decide to contribute, I'll give you access to the repo if it ever does
go private.
